      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an uncomfortable feeling when you have to tell your mom that the internet service she had been paying for had just been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the mid to late &amp;lsquo;90s and the latest craze was the statd exploit that had been released for Solaris. I had a list of potential targets (thank you nmap) and wasn&amp;rsquo;t really looking to do much, but being young and stupid I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give one target a quick test without using any of hiding techniques that typically accompanied a more thought out attack. Fifteen minutes later I was explaining to my mom why she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to read her e-mail anymore. She didn&amp;rsquo;t really mind as she wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of Pine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s go back a few years&amp;hellip; Your typical upper lower/lower middle class home. Single mom who is dating a dick. Young male teenager. The situation made-for-tv movies are usually based around. The internet has just started creeping into the mainstream and AOL is king. Windows 95 is the shit.
My mom and her boyfriend had just come back from some create your own business rip-off conference thing and were convinced they were about to make it big reselling random shit. In order to be a legit business though they needed a computer, every business had a computer right?
At that point I was the happiest kid around because my school had started accepting typed reports instead of handwritten and my family was about to get a computer. I could have given two fucks about the internet, I just wanted a text editor and a printer. It took a while for them to build up the computer fund but they did it and I can still remember going to K-mart to get some generic, shitty ass pentium 133Mhz PC. Of course the great business plan failed and the computer ended up being primarily used by me. Early on I just did school reports but at some point the AOL bug bit and I found myself doing what most teenagers on AOL did at that time: acting like an idiot in chat rooms. Now I had ventured out on to that scary world wide web place but not very often, everything I needed was right in AOL and life was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my life changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person in a random chat room was &amp;ldquo;hacking us&amp;rdquo;. When I say &amp;ldquo;hacking us&amp;rdquo;, I mean spamming the shit out of the channel to the point where nobody else could get a word in. I had heard of &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; before, my friend and I had even created an encrypted file once on an old Apple with the flying toasters screen saver, but this was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d seen something like this. How could this single person essentially take over and control a chat room managed/owned by AOL? I &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to know how this person was doing this and so began my journey&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll skip over the boring part where I started creating websites with flaming skulls, loading up the latest AOL scripts and playing around with virus &amp;ldquo;generators&amp;rdquo;. The important thing that happened during this period was my discovery of texts and zines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started to go deeper down the rabbit hole the need to read everything out there started taking over. There were times where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed but instead would lock myself away in my room, read texts all night and then go to school in the morning with little to no sleep. This new world I was discovering was amazing, you could cobble together some nonsense (code) and end up with something that allowed you to gain access to another computer! You could take a fucking whistle from a cereal box and use it to work your way through phone systems! Sadly, by the time I had come across most of this stuff it had already been fixed but that didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, the fire had been lit and now I was all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the &amp;ldquo;legit&amp;rdquo; people were using Linux so I spent a week downloading the different packages for a Slackware install and put them all on 3.5&amp;rdquo; floppies only to have the install fail. I should mention that up until this point I had basically zero Linux experience. Luckily for me there was Cheap Bytes which was a site that would burn everything to a CD and mail it to you for a small fee. A few weeks later that old 133Mhz Windows 95 computer was a lean and mean Linux box. I can still remember the panic when I saw that &amp;ldquo;darkstar login&amp;rdquo; prompt come up. What the hell had I done? As I said earlier, I was all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I just spent my time learning what the hell I was doing. Things that seem basic today were quite a bit more interesting back then. An example would be setting up your PPP dial-up connection when you had no clue what PPP was. These first couple of months with Linux were really the first time in my short computer using history that I had to start problem solving and reading documentation to figure out what to do next. A lot of it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense but I was able to piece enough of it together to get a functioning system up and running that would allow me to connect to the internet, send and receive e-mail and browse the web with lynx. The satisfaction of building my own Linux kernel was pretty awesome. Sure I was just following a menu-based system, but the fact that I had to take source code and turn it into this working blob of magic was pretty badass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was in full on consume mode. My nights and early mornings were still being spent searching and reading. Places like linenoise.org, bronc buster&amp;rsquo;s forum, the l0pht and technotronic were like fucking crack. I had the hacker&amp;rsquo;s manifesto memorized. I knew all about war dialing and to prove it I had one angry fellow call my house and leave a message after my war dialer had called him multiple times between 1-4am. Luckily I was able to delete that message before my mom heard it. My friends were playing video games, watching TV or doing homework at night while I was reading monospaced font filled text files one after another, writing perl scripts and learning the amazing world of awk and sed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we&amp;rsquo;ll fast forward a bit to a time when the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ihatefeds.com/ashtray-lumberjacks_0wn3rsh1p.pdf&#34;&gt;ashtray lumberjacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ytcracker.com/&#34;&gt;ytcracker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milw0rm&#34;&gt;milw0rm&lt;/a&gt; were making waves. I was in a small but tight knit group (telehack.net yo!) whose main fame, aside from a few webpage defacement shout outs, was our large stash of texts and zines. Also that time we had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://cd.textfiles.com/plamedia/text/United%20Phone%20Losers%20Text%20Files/UPL014.txt&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;feud&amp;rdquo; with the UPL&lt;/a&gt;. We were all addicted to learning so we just took all of the files we already had locally and combined them into a single site. Outside of that we did what I think the majority of bored teens in our world did back then which was hang out on IRC 80% of the time, dabble in some gray area security things and read. I was lucky enough to live in an area that had a fairly vibrant hacker culture (_&lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt;_ 303) and although I never made it to a 2600 meeting on the 16th st mall, I did meet a few like-minded individuals to help bolster my skills and add to the knowledge I was accumulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is where I talk about how I never liked school but was still able to get amazing grades, go to MIT and become some badass computer/technology guy. Unfortunately (maybe fortunately?) that wasn&amp;rsquo;t me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like school but because of that I never went which meant I got shitty grades. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to college because I had shitty grades and was never going to be able to afford it without some type of scholarship. I&amp;rsquo;m not a genius or one of those people who think at another level. I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy who likes to learn and tinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does an 18 year old who isn&amp;rsquo;t going to college do? Get a job so they can GTFO! A few weeks after I had graduated high school I was interviewing at a shitty shipping company for a sysadmin position responsible for two NT boxes, three QNX boxes and about 10 diskless stations where the workers scanned packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All connected via an ARCNET setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Zebra thermal printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am certain that if hell exists it is a cold (below freezing), dusty world where your only job is to keep Zebra thermal printers working. I will never take a job again that involves those horrible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting the job and was just killing it (in a good way). By the end of my first year I had scripted most of our processes so that even the non-computer people could do some of the more mundane tasks like uploading inventory files, looking up packages in the database, etc which meant I could spend more time on the fun things. I ended up making our location the spot to send your jacked up Zebra printers to for repair and at 19 years old was being flown around to fill in for IT managers when they were on vacation. What was really amazing was that I had full health care, a 401k and was making just about twice as much a year as my mom had ever made. I don&amp;rsquo;t say that to be negative or to slam my mom, she did the best with what she had and managed to keep me fed and clothed, even if it did come from food stamps or government programs. The key takeaway is that because of technology, at 19 years old, I was already living an arguably better life than either of my parents had ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, think about that for a minute and try to understand how much of a game changer that is, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That single job was a foundation for a career that in my mid-thirties allows me to live comfortably and debt free, own a home, raise a child who has access to everything he needs and occasionally even do fun things like take vacations to another country. All of that with no formal education. What other industry would you ever find that in? I am not well versed in all of the other roles and trades, but I am willing to bet that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare. Even the more &amp;ldquo;blue collar&amp;rdquo; jobs typically require some type of apprenticeship (aka formal schooling) before you can actually start your career. Most jobs in the world of computers need either proof of formal education or experience. This experience is what has allowed me to climb the career ladder and get to a point that as a kid I never thought was possible. Do you know where that entry level education that allowed me to get that job came from? From those years as a teenager that I spent dicking around on the computer being a script kiddie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the serious level up a notch. Think about how much luck was involved in order for that computer to enter my home so many years ago. I am almost certain that had it not been for that computer I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be living the lifestyle that I have now. Now think about how many other children do not have such luck and never get the chance to get in flame wars on IRC or read 2600. Are we shorting a huge section of our population and missing out on talent? I know people will say things like &amp;ldquo;you could have used computers at the library&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;you could have used school computers&amp;rdquo; but that is bullshit. The availability of both of those locations is pretty limited and typically locked down with regards to what you can access. People who are not born with the gift need to be able to immerse themselves in the world of computers with no roadblocks or barriers, that&amp;rsquo;s how we make up for the lack of natural talent. Also you can&amp;rsquo;t install python on those computers to make 1337 scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the part where I talk about the purpose of this post and that is to ask: what are you doing to help evangelize the world of computers? Are you donating time and/or money to organizations that help people who might not typically have computer access get it? Are you giving your old (but still working) hardware to someone who could really use it? Are you explaining to your nieces and nephews not only what a payphone is but how you used to use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phonelosers.org/redbox/&#34;&gt;redbox&lt;/a&gt; to get free calls on those ancient artifacts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has to be a developer so think outside of that. Think about all of those DBAs out there or the desktop PC admins. What about the network engineers or the Active Directory people (god bless their souls)? Take the opportunity to help the kids who have no idea what the world of computers can offer them and help them realize what is possible. Go out and light a fire under the ones who are into it, show them cool shit! Setup a hack day at your work and invite schools from lower income areas to come in and hack on hardware or software. Show them some of the cool stuff you can do with computers and help them understand what is out there waiting for them if they want to work at it. If you have a story like mine share it! It&amp;rsquo;s great to talk about computers if you come from a privileged  background (seriously, it is), but it&amp;rsquo;s even more impactful when you can talk about a story that relates to the world they live in. Shit, share it at your local users group or meetup in the hopes that someone else is inspired and starts helping. Have no clue where to start? My contact info is at the top of the page, contact me and I&amp;rsquo;d love to help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hand Wired Keyboard pt2</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hand-wired-keyboard-part-2&#34;&gt;Hand Wired Keyboard Part 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;a href=&#34;http://esheavyindustries.com/2016/04/hand-wired-keyboard-pt1/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; I had a working keyboard but it had to be plugged in via USB. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used a wired keyboard in probably five years so having this
one wired made me sad. There were a few hints at how people had done bluetooth + teensy setups (the teensy is the brains) but no real tutorials or anything. So as I typically do when presented with
an electronics project, I headed over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adafruit.com&#34;&gt;adafruit&lt;/a&gt; to see how much I could get already pre-built for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had the battery/charging stuff from a previous project so all I needed was something for the bluetooth. Guess what? They have a part for that: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/1535&#34;&gt;bluefruit EZ-Key&lt;/a&gt;. This little guy has the ability to take input in on it&amp;rsquo;s UART port and fire it off via bluetooth, perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I had to figure out
the wiring as I wanted to be able to charge the battery via the teensy USB port as opposed to using the USB port on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/1904&#34;&gt;lipo charger board&lt;/a&gt;. There is a small trace on the teensy that you can cut
to stop the USB port from actually providing power (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/external_power.html&#34;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;) which sounded like what I wanted so I had a few drinks to steady my hand, pulled out the xacto knife and made the cut.
After that it was just a matter of getting the TX/RX from the teensy hooked up to the EZ-Key and then the power + charging coming from the lipo charger board to the teensy. Here is an amazing
diagram I put together showing what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb-bluetooth.png&#34; alt=&#34;wiring diagram&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;pro schematic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center 5v pad on the teensy is powered by the USB plug, so to charge the battery I just plug the keyboard up via USB to a power source and I&amp;rsquo;m good to go. What the awesome
diagram doesn&amp;rsquo;t show is a small switch I added on the &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; wire between the charger board and teensy so that I can turn off the keyboard when I&amp;rsquo;m not using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup was functional and it worked correctly but because of the extra components (mainly the battery) the original spacers that came with the keyboard didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I tried about five different
arrangements but every time I ended up pinching a diode or something causing the keyboard to do strange things on certain keys. The solution was to just order some taller spacers. This means that I
will need to order a new middle piece cut from acrylic in order to hide all the guts but honestly I kind of like the exposed look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to the firmware, a few changes had to be made so I did my best to pretend to be a C programmer. The biggest change was renaming a bunch of macros that had at some point been renamed
and never updated across the TMK code base, you can see the PR I submitted for that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/pull/341&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After that was done it was basically just a matter of
copying the bluetooth converter sample project in TMK and updating it to fit my actual keyboard. You can see the changes I made &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/esell/tmk_keyboard/commits/neutrino&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Please keep in mind that the keymap being used is very basic and there is a lot of clean-up that could be done. This was simply just to verify everything was working as it should.:w&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hand-wired-keyboard-part-1&#34;&gt;Hand Wired Keyboard Part 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been toying with the idea of buying a mechanical keyboard for a few years but the bug didn&amp;rsquo;t really hit until about 8 months ago. Me being me I thought &amp;ldquo;why just buy one
when I could build it myself?!&amp;ldquo;. It turns out that putting your own mechanical keyboard together is kind of a pain in the ass, that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to build a keyboard, time to actually research what it takes to build a keyboard. As with most things, the keyboard community has it&amp;rsquo;s own terms, language and acronyms so I spent
the majority of the first month trying to figure out what the hell they were talking about and mapping their lingo to the actual parts I would need. At this point I thought I had a pretty good idea
on what I needed so I went out to source probably the most important part of a keyboard: the switches. These are what your key caps go onto and what actually send the computer a signal that something
has happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/keyboard1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cherry switch&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;made of baby parts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there are about 500 fucking kinds of switches out there and they all do different things just a tiny bit differently. Some are &amp;ldquo;linear&amp;rdquo;, some are &amp;ldquo;tactile bump&amp;rdquo; and some can even be &amp;ldquo;tactile click&amp;rdquo;. That is just a small sampling and those are the major categories, under those are tons of other categories that ends up creating this insane matrix of keyboard switches.
I knew I wanted something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t super &amp;ldquo;clicky&amp;rdquo; because that is annoying so I was told to check out the &amp;ldquo;cherry mx brown&amp;rdquo; switch. This should have been the first sign of what I was getting into. Go out to Google/Amazon/eBay and try to find 60-80 cherry mx brown switches, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait. Turns out these things (as well as other cherry mx switches) are in such high demand that they are hardly ever available. When they do pop up they sell out super quick unless it happens to match-up with one of their big shipments that I guess only happen a couple times a year. Anyways, I was coming up empty handed
everywhere I looked so I had to go the message board group-buy route. Luckily the group-buy was legit and I ended up with all the switches I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, so now I needed something to put those switches into aka the &amp;ldquo;plate&amp;rdquo;. I knew I wanted a ~65% style keyboard which is basically a typical keyboard stripped of all the non-essential stuff (for me). Things like function keys, media keys, etc.
I came across a few sites (&lt;a href=&#34;http://builder.swillkb.com/&#34;&gt;plate &amp;amp; case builder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/&#34;&gt;keyboard layout editor&lt;/a&gt;) that allowed you to design your own keyboard layout and then create a CAD type file from those layouts which could then be provided to a shop or vendor who could cut the pattern out in metal, plastic, whatever.
So I created my layout, created my CAD files for the plates (top and bottom) and headed over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigbluesaw.com/&#34;&gt;big blue saw&lt;/a&gt; to get my quote. For one set of plates it was going to cost me ~$90!! Now I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that the pricing from big blue saw is out of line, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I was expecting. Once you order five or more sets of the plates the pricing was almost cut in half but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to find that many people who wanted to make their own keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By pure chance I came across someone online talking about their &amp;ldquo;neutrino&amp;rdquo; build. It was a 65% keyboard that was being sold by &lt;a href=&#34;http://olkb.com/&#34;&gt;Ortholinear Keyboards&lt;/a&gt; and it was right in my price range so I went ahead and pulled the trigger. This ended up being yet another pain that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t anticipating as due to a previous group buy offered by Ortholinear Keyboards, they were so backed up with orders that my stuff didn&amp;rsquo;t ship for over four months. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m starting to realize that things in the mechanical keyboard game don&amp;rsquo;t come easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the plates for the keyboard finally arrived I grabbed all the other parts I had ordered and went to town. Initially I had talked myself into believing that soldering all of these random diodes and wires wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be an issue and that I&amp;rsquo;d knock it out in no time. wrong. wrong. Through hole soldering will never (never!) prepare you for the pain that is soldering a hand wired keyboard. If you are reading this right now because you are thinking about doing this I HIGHLY suggest you either make your own PCB or buy a kit that comes with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stupidly sat down at my table, spread everything out in front of me and assumed in an hour I&amp;rsquo;d have a keyboard ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb/parts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;keyboard parts&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;what you need for a keyboard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggested process is to put all of your switches in and then start wiring up the rows (which includes the diodes) and then the columns so that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did.
It quickly became evident that there is no easy way to solder the diodes onto the switch and then to the other diode across from it. I tried about five different techniques and none of them really made it easy. Having a few drinks however did make me less angry so that is my suggestion if you plan on doing this: alcohol + hours of spare time.
Between trying various ways to make it easier, throwing things and actual soldering it took me about 30 minutes to do the first row. If you&amp;rsquo;re keeping track you&amp;rsquo;ll realize that based on my initial time calculations that left me with 30 minutes to solder four more rows. I decided to just shut it down and work on the other rows later which in hindsight was probably the right call.
The next day I was able to come back knowing what type of pain I was in for and just power through it. The result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb/rows.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;keyboard rows&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;never again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rows were done so that meant the columns were next. No diodes this time just straight up wire, no problem right? Nope. You don&amp;rsquo;t want the wiring to touch so that means you need to leave the shielding on the wiring you use for the columns. So to expose the wire I needed to solder I just used my pocket knife and stripped away small sections where I needed the bare wire exposed. That process took me way too long. The actual soldering was way easier than the rows though so I was able to cruise through that pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb/rows_columns.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;keyboard rows and columns&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;are we there yet?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh god I&amp;rsquo;m so close at this point&amp;rdquo; is all I could think when it came time to wire up the teensy. The teensy is basically the brains of the keyboard and connected to the various rows and columns I had created earlier. Routing the wires was kind of a pain but nothing crazy and overall this was probably the least stressful part of the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb/teensy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;keyboard with the teensy&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;so.damn.close.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I attached the base plate but left out the middle acrylic piece because I needed access to the reset button on the teensy and had plans to re-work a few things anyways. I also put the actual key caps on and went to town creating the firmware needed to make this beast actually type. A group of people way smarter than I am have a great firmware project out on Github just for projects like this, it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard&#34;&gt;TMK&lt;/a&gt; and is actually pretty easy to use.
Since all keyboards are going to be different, TMK has you pass in what your keyboard matrix looks like and then what you want each key to do when it&amp;rsquo;s pressed. TMK also has this concept of layers which is great for my 65% board as I can still have the functionality of say, media keys, I just need to use a specific key sequence to activate it. As an example I don&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;tilde&amp;rdquo; key by default so if I press fn + Esc I&amp;rsquo;ll get a tilde.
Anyways, I got the firmware to compile and loaded it onto the teensy and it actually worked! Below is the final keyboard with a few keys that I&amp;rsquo;ll have to swap out as they are not the right size/type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/kb/kb-final.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;final keyboard&#34; data-jslghtbx&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;tada!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I&amp;rsquo;m at currently but the project is not complete. The idea of having to use a wired keyboard in 2016 makes me sad so the next phase will be to hook in a bluetooth + battery setup so I can use this POS without an ugly USB cable attached to it. For now though I&amp;rsquo;m going to take some time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixie-clock-part-1-a&#34;&gt;Nixie clock part 1-a&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So things have changed. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken out the Arudino and replaced it with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/2000&#34;&gt;Adafruit Pro Trinket&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally I updated the PCB so show the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/1588&#34;&gt;Adafruit Bluefruit&lt;/a&gt; and took out the homebrew RTC circuit and just went with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/3013&#34;&gt;Adafruit DS3231 breakout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/nixieclock-small_pcb2.png&#34; alt=&#34;nixie PCB&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;still looks like shit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for these changes was mainly just for simplicity. The new parts are easier to source, come from a vendor who I know makes really good/cool stuff and it makes my life a bit easier. Now I&amp;rsquo;m off to eBay to start the search for nixie tubes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixie-clock-part-1&#34;&gt;Nixie clock part 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy building things and for some reason, I tend to enjoy building more &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; things. Awhile back I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/products/194&#34;&gt;Adafruit Ice Tube Clock Kit&lt;/a&gt; which I thought was one amazing looking clock. Unfortunately they discontinued it but since I enjoy making things harder on myself than they should be, I went to Google to try and find something similar. What I came across was a pretty popular project called a nixie clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/nixie1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;example nixie clock&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;example of a nixie clock&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nixie clock is simply a clock that is built using multiple &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube&#34;&gt;nixie tubes&lt;/a&gt; for the display. They come in all sorts of different sizes and shapes which makes it easy to design a clock for whatever purpose you want (small desk clock, larger wall clock, etc). In my case I wanted something similar to the Adafruit clock, small enough that I could put it on a desk but still big enough to show off some of the components. I like the mechanical look so I had planned on putting everything in some type of clear case so you could see all of the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not an electronics guy at all, I can take a bag of parts with a schematic or instructions and solder it all together, but if you are looking at me to design a circuit from the ground up then you are in for a world of hurt.
Luckily there are a bunch of smart people out there that have built nixie clocks before and have been kind enough to share. One of those people is Andrew Saxén who has not only a great write-up on how he built his nixie clock, but also links to the code that runs it as well as the PCB layout. You can check it out at his site &lt;a href=&#34;http://codeterrific.com/arduino/nixie-clock-build&#34;&gt;Code Terrific&lt;/a&gt;. There are tons of other links out there showing various builds, but for whatever reason Adam&amp;rsquo;s just seemed to click with me so I decided I was going to use what he had already done as my &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chop-chop&#34;&gt;chop chop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my project all I wanted was a clock, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care about temp or humidity so there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to include a DHT22 sensor in the build. Additionally, as of right now I plan on having the PCB printed as opposed to etching one at home. This means I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to take advantage of using a two sided PCB. The third change from Adam&amp;rsquo;s original design I&amp;rsquo;d like to make is to directly integrate his real-time clock circuit into the nixie PCB, that way everything is all in one spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that I downloaded the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fritzing.org/home/&#34;&gt;Fritzing&lt;/a&gt; application and set out to re-create Adam&amp;rsquo;s PCB as best I could. Once I had that I started to strip away things I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d need, add some new things and then try and condense it down as much as possible to save on costs. Part of me wanted to make a really nice looking PCB but for my first attempt the cost would have been a bit more than I wanted to spend. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking if this turns out ok I can always re-use the nixie tubes and create a new, fancier PCB later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://esheavyindustries.com/pics/nixieclock-small_pcb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;nixie PCB&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;holy rats nest!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your skills are at hobbyist electronics person or above I apologize for the mess that is the PCB above :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this design it would be about ~$58 for three boards from &lt;a href=&#34;https://oshpark.com&#34;&gt;OSH Park&lt;/a&gt; which isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad for me. With a small child around and a full-time job the ability for me to find time to hand etch these is highly unlikely so it makes more sense to just bite the bullet and have someone else print them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base PCB isn&amp;rsquo;t finalized but I think it&amp;rsquo;s close enough for now. The next thing that I have been thinking about is how to mount the tubes. Part of me would like to make an additional PCB and have the tubes slot right into that PCB and then connect it to the other PCB either via headers or a ribbon cable. The problem with that is since I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much useless, I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to design the libraries needed to mock out IN-8 tubes and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find any existing resources. Everyone seems to have the IN-12A but I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the look of those as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=4_11&amp;amp;products_id=74&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; pre-built &amp;ldquo;sockets&amp;rdquo; from pv electronics. Outside of having a nice way to interface with the tubes though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much they would get me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option is do just do what Adam did and run the wires directly to the tubes. I think if I could do this in a fairly clean manner it would look pretty cool and go with the whole mechanical/exposed look I want.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have some extra cash maybe you would consider donating some of it to one of the various open source projects that you likely use almost every single day? I know it is easy to forgot about where many of the things we use on a daily basis come from, but odds are that if you are reading this you probably use some kind of open source app.
Where would you be without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; to securely connect to your servers?
I know I&amp;rsquo;d personally be fucked without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haproxy.org/&#34;&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt; doing the load balancing for many of the apps I&amp;rsquo;ve supported.
What about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;? Sure it might not be the hot tech now but how many of you have used it as your HTTP server both at work or for your personal site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make is that there are many (many!) tools that we use on a daily basis that someone (or a group of someones) are building, fixing and maintaining that make our lives easier.
Some of these have big corporate sponsors but many of them do not.
A lot of these people have other jobs they use to pay the bills and then work on their open source projects during their &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; time.
Some groups build products, others focus on your rights (take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/button&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; for example). Others, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; project, do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to make a list of some of the open source tools you use on a daily basis and consider donating either money or time to those projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>deb-simple, a no frills apt repository server</title>
      <link>https://esheavyindustries.com/2016/02/deb-simple-a-no-frills-apt-repository-server/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 01:46:49 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://esheavyindustries.com/2016/02/deb-simple-a-no-frills-apt-repository-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently needed an simple way to serve up debian packages via apt-get for our internal apps. Oddly enough finding something that fit our needs was a bit harder than I thought. We needed something that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported multiple versions of the same package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t care about signing or &amp;ldquo;changes&amp;rdquo; files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed us to upload via an API or some type of incoming directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could handle multiple packages coming in at once without corrupting the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was easy to setup/maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few services out there that fit our needs but they were not free so I took a shot at building an app to fit our use-case. The outcome was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/esell/deb-simple&#34;&gt;deb-simple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently it supports uploading packages via POST, deleting packages via DELETE and does a good job (I think) of making sure the repository listing doesn&amp;rsquo;t become corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
