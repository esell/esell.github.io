      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people&amp;rsquo;s new years resolution was to lose weight, others was to give themselves more &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; time. Mine was to move off of as much SaaS offerings as I could in an attempt
to start taking back my privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, there are a lot of SaaS solutions out there that are awesome and take away the burden of having to manage a server but I felt that there was just too
much of my info being spread across these sites. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a single event that triggered my new goal to move everything to my own infrastructure, it was more that I was
noticing that every couple of months I felt like I was signing up for new SaaS apps or connecting to a new app via another service I already had an account on.
I had already closed down my social media accounts, which were probably the ones I had to worry about the most, but wanted to take the next step to independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First on my list was this site. I had been thinking of moving it for some time as hosting it on Github pages didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to use SSL unless I used something like Cloudflare which I didn&amp;rsquo;t want
to do. Most of the big cloud providers have some type of blob storage that works great for static sites, but again, at the time none of them had what I would call acceptable
SSL support. The solution I ended up going with was a small VM with one of the large cloud providers and setup disk encryption (with my key) to make sure it really was &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;.
Now I needed a web server. I had been an Apache guy most of my life but that felt too heavy for what I wanted. I had heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://caddyserver.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; and after reading the
docs it sounded like a perfect fit. It was easy to setup, has support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; out of the box and also has a nifty git plugin that pulls in my static
site from my git repo whenever the content has changed. It took me about 5 minutes to get things up and running at which point I had one item off of my checklist. Caddy is awesome and as you&amp;rsquo;ll see later,
it ended up being the hub of most of my solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next item was how to get off of Github and the random services I had connected into it like TravisCI and Coveralls. The part I struggled with here was the social aspect of it. Not so much stars, watchers, etc but more of the PR and issue management system. Granted I don&amp;rsquo;t have any high-profile repos but at the same time I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to put up a barrier to prevent people from submitting
something. Asking someone to create a user/pass just for my shitty git repo wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option. As luck would have it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitea.io/en-US/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gitea&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fork of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gogs.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gogs&lt;/a&gt; had just sprung up. Gitea has been much more active with regards to commits and one of those commits just happened to be supporting authentication via Github! I pulled down the source, got it all built
and dropped it behind my Caddy server, again with it&amp;rsquo;s own fancy Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt cert. Is Gitea a bit rough around the edges? Sure, but it covers everything I need and is fairly lightweight,
easy to setup/maintain and can use sqlite as a backend so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to manage a database server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a solution to my git repo hosting, now what about replacing TravisCI and Coveralls? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked! This part of my self-hosting process ended up being a bit more work than I expected.
To replace TravisCI I went with self-hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/drone/drone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drone&lt;/a&gt;. Drone was pretty easy to get going since it comes as a Docker image so once I had it fired up I simply
logged in and enabled it for the repos I wanted. The &lt;code&gt;.drone.yml&lt;/code&gt; file took a bit of work to get working with the native go vendoring system but I eventually got it working. Coveralls was next up on
the list and surprisingly I didn&amp;rsquo;t find very many open source options. I ended up hacking together &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.esheavyindustries.com/esell/hoptocopter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;hoptocopter&lt;/a&gt; which actually
just uses the native go test coverage tooling and then spits out one of those fancy badges via &lt;a href=&#34;http://shields.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid having to call their API I used the wonderful
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/beevelop/docker-shields&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shields docker image&lt;/a&gt; provided by beevelop. From there I just setup a Docker compose file that started up hoptocopter and shields together and bam!
Instant code coverage badges. At this point I had basically re-created everything I had in Github. There were some things I couldn&amp;rsquo;t implement such as builds being triggered by PRs, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t
a huge deal to me so I considered it a success. Guess what I used to front these? If you said Caddy you&amp;rsquo;d be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously this site had used Google Analytics for metrics. I actually like the product and enjoy seeing all of the cool data about my site but Google and privacy do not belong in the same
sentence. My next goal was to rid myself of Google Analytics and find something I could run on my server but that still had an easy to use UI. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goaccess.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GoAccess&lt;/a&gt;.
Really nothing to say about GoAccess outside of it just works. It parses the log files from Caddy and turns them into a pretty html page. This page is served up by&amp;hellip; Caddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password management, a great debate topic. Do you use a fancy hosted tool like LastPass or do you use something you can store locally like KeePass? The answer for me was neither, I went with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.passwordstore.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pass&lt;/a&gt; which is a super simple (good) way to manage your passwords but still be able to access them on most devices including my Android phone. I setup pass to
use git as a storage location by setting up a private repo on my new Gitea setup. I lost a tiny bit of functionality over something like LastPass, but nothing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do without. If you
wanted to be super crazy you could use something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git-remote-gcrypt&lt;/a&gt; to encrypt your actual git repo. Double the encryption, double the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have to talk about the things I haven&amp;rsquo;t come up with a good solution for (yet). The biggest is e-mail. A few years ago I tried hosting my own mail server and did everything the internet
says to do to avoid your e-mails being flagged as spam. Unfortunately that didn&amp;rsquo;t work and about 80% of my e-mails ended up in the spam folder of my friends and family. I am currently using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://protonmail.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Protonmail&lt;/a&gt; which is great and I have no real problems with, it&amp;rsquo;s just that I don&amp;rsquo;t have those messages on my own server so I have to trust that everything
they say they do is actually true. That&amp;rsquo;s a fairly big thing to do but at this point I just have to suck it up and deal with it.
The second area is image and video sharing. Things like Google Drive or Google Photos are great products but again, Google. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking around for some open source alternatives
and haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything yet that meets my needs. I want to be able to send photos right from my phone to the app on my server and then send out generated links to family members
to access those files all while keeping them hidden from everyone else. I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed around with hacking something together but I have to believe that an app like this already exists
so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a bit left to do like moving all of my Github repos over to my Gitea setup but so far I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying the new freedom. Since most of these apps are pretty low
maintenance I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to do much sysadmin type work which is great. If that will still be the same six months from now I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have some extra cash? Help make your life easier</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have some extra cash maybe you would consider donating some of it to one of the various open source projects that you likely use almost every single day? I know it is easy to forgot about where many of the things we use on a daily basis come from, but odds are that if you are reading this you probably use some kind of open source app.
Where would you be without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; to securely connect to your servers?
I know I&amp;rsquo;d personally be fucked without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haproxy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt; doing the load balancing for many of the apps I&amp;rsquo;ve supported.
What about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;? Sure it might not be the hot tech now but how many of you have used it as your HTTP server both at work or for your personal site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make is that there are many (many!) tools that we use on a daily basis that someone (or a group of someones) are building, fixing and maintaining that make our lives easier.
Some of these have big corporate sponsors but many of them do not.
A lot of these people have other jobs they use to pay the bills and then work on their open source projects during their &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; time.
Some groups build products, others focus on your rights (take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/button&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; for example). Others, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; project, do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to make a list of some of the open source tools you use on a daily basis and consider donating either money or time to those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
