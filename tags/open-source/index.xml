      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have some extra cash maybe you would consider donating some of it to one of the various open source projects that you likely use almost every single day? I know it is easy to forgot about where many of the things we use on a daily basis come from, but odds are that if you are reading this you probably use some kind of open source app.
Where would you be without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; to securely connect to your servers?
I know I&amp;rsquo;d personally be fucked without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haproxy.org/&#34;&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt; doing the load balancing for many of the apps I&amp;rsquo;ve supported.
What about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;? Sure it might not be the hot tech now but how many of you have used it as your HTTP server both at work or for your personal site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make is that there are many (many!) tools that we use on a daily basis that someone (or a group of someones) are building, fixing and maintaining that make our lives easier.
Some of these have big corporate sponsors but many of them do not.
A lot of these people have other jobs they use to pay the bills and then work on their open source projects during their &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; time.
Some groups build products, others focus on your rights (take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/button&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; for example). Others, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; project, do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to make a list of some of the open source tools you use on a daily basis and consider donating either money or time to those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
