      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently needed an simple way to serve up debian packages via apt-get for our internal apps. Oddly enough finding something that fit our needs was a bit harder than I thought. We needed something that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported multiple versions of the same package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t care about signing or &amp;ldquo;changes&amp;rdquo; files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed us to upload via an API or some type of incoming directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could handle multiple packages coming in at once without corrupting the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was easy to setup/maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few services out there that fit our needs but they were not free so I took a shot at building an app to fit our use-case. The outcome was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/esell/deb-simple&#34;&gt;deb-simple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently it supports uploading packages via POST, deleting packages via DELETE and does a good job (I think) of making sure the repository listing doesn&amp;rsquo;t become corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
