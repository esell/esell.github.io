<h1 id="hand-wired-keyboard-part-2:52018684934fd9b6304b3e70662af65e">Hand Wired Keyboard Part 2</h1>

<p>At the end of <a href="http://esheavyindustries.com/2016/04/hand-wired-keyboard-pt1/">part 1</a> I had a working keyboard but it had to be plugged in via USB. I haven&rsquo;t used a wired keyboard in probably five years so having this
one wired made me sad. There were a few hints at how people had done bluetooth + teensy setups (the teensy is the brains) but no real tutorials or anything. So as I typically do when presented with
an electronics project, I headed over to <a href="http://adafruit.com">adafruit</a> to see how much I could get already pre-built for me.</p>

<p>I already had the battery/charging stuff from a previous project so all I needed was something for the bluetooth. Guess what? They have a part for that: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1535">bluefruit EZ-Key</a>. This little guy has the ability to take input in on it&rsquo;s UART port and fire it off via bluetooth, perfect!</p>

<p>Now I had to figure out
the wiring as I wanted to be able to charge the battery via the teensy USB port as opposed to using the USB port on the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1904">lipo charger board</a>. There is a small trace on the teensy that you can cut
to stop the USB port from actually providing power (<a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/external_power.html">see here</a>) which sounded like what I wanted so I had a few drinks to steady my hand, pulled out the xacto knife and made the cut.
After that it was just a matter of getting the TX/RX from the teensy hooked up to the EZ-Key and then the power + charging coming from the lipo charger board to the teensy. Here is an amazing
diagram I put together showing what I did:</p>

<p><center>
<figure>
  <img src="/pics/kb-bluetooth.png" alt="wiring diagram" data-jslghtbx>
    <figcaption><b>pro schematic</b></figcaption>
</figure>
</center></p>

<p>The center 5v pad on the teensy is powered by the USB plug, so to charge the battery I just plug the keyboard up via USB to a power source and I&rsquo;m good to go. What the awesome
diagram doesn&rsquo;t show is a small switch I added on the &ldquo;power&rdquo; wire between the charger board and teensy so that I can turn off the keyboard when I&rsquo;m not using it.</p>

<p>This setup was functional and it worked correctly but because of the extra components (mainly the battery) the original spacers that came with the keyboard didn&rsquo;t work. I tried about five different
arrangements but every time I ended up pinching a diode or something causing the keyboard to do strange things on certain keys. The solution was to just order some taller spacers. This means that I
will need to order a new middle piece cut from acrylic in order to hide all the guts but honestly I kind of like the exposed look.</p>

<p>With regards to the firmware, a few changes had to be made so I did my best to pretend to be a C programmer. The biggest change was renaming a bunch of macros that had at some point been renamed
and never updated across the TMK code base, you can see the PR I submitted for that <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/pull/341">here</a>. After that was done it was basically just a matter of
copying the bluetooth converter sample project in TMK and updating it to fit my actual keyboard. You can see the changes I made <a href="https://github.com/esell/tmk_keyboard/commits/neutrino">here</a>.
Please keep in mind that the keymap being used is very basic and there is a lot of clean-up that could be done. This was simply just to verify everything was working as it should.:w</p>
